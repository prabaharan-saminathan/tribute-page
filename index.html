            Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer.
            She is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early
            mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her
            notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first
            algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making her the
            first computer programmer.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his
            wife Anne Isabella Milbanke. She showed her gift for mathematics
            from an early age and was tutored in science and logic, which was
            unusual for women of her time.
          </p>
          <h2>Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            Ada's contributions to computer science include her visionary work
            on the Analytical Engine. She realized that the machine could carry
            out a series of instructions beyond mere calculation, laying the
            groundwork for modern computer programming.
